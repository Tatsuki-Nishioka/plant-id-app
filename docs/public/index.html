Also, Melanolepis multiglandulosa (Euphorbiaceae) twigs exude a bluish sap when bruised!","植物の樹液や樹脂などの分泌物は特徴的であることがあり、例えば、傷つけたり切ったりすると粘着性のラテックスを生成することがある。樹液は白色、無色、透明であることもあるが、時には特有の色がゆっくりと現れることもある。この特徴は標本から直接知覚するのは難しいが、採集者によってしばしば記録される。あまり一般的ではないが、それでも印象的なのは、緑色の樹液を持つ種で、これは二つの例のみが知られている：Kingiodendron（以前はPrioria、マメ科）と一部のPhyllanthus属（ex. コミカンソウ科のP. balgooyi）。また、トウダイグサ科のMelanolepis multiglandulosaの小枝は、傷つけると青みがかった樹液を分泌する。",{"id":112,"category":11593,"categoryJpn":11594,"detail":11595,"detailJpn":11596},"Characteristic Smells","特徴的な匂い","Distinctive smells when a branch or stem is cut, or when leaves are torn or crushed, can give good clues to identifying some taxa. Thus, bruised bark (or sometimes crushed leaves) could release the smell of almonds (Prunus), garlic (Scorodocarpus), sugarcane (Xanthophyllum), wintergreen or salicylic acid (Gaultheria), or be fragrant (Magnolia p.p.), and so on. Not all smells are distinctive and here, only two types that are persistent even on herbarium specimens are listed","枝や茎を切ったとき、または葉を裂いたり潰したりしたときに特有の匂いがすることは、いくつかの分類群を特定するための良い手掛かりとなる。例えば、傷つけた樹皮（または時には潰した葉）は、アーモンド（Prunus）、ニンニク（Scorodocarpus）、サトウキビ（Xanthophyllum）、ウィンターグリーンやサリチル酸（Gaultheria）の匂いを放ったり、芳香を放ったり（Magnolia属の一部）、といった特徴がある。しかし、すべての匂いが特徴的なわけではない。ここでは、標本においても持続する二つのタイプの臭いのみをリストに含める。",{"id":9,"category":11598,"categoryJpn":11599,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Stipule Characters","托葉",{"id":10,"category":11601,"categoryJpn":11602,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Petioles and Rachises","葉柄と葉軸",{"id":11,"category":11604,"categoryJpn":11605,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Leaf Arrangement","葉序",{"id":201,"category":11607,"categoryJpn":11608,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Leaf Form and Size","葉の形状と大きさ",{"id":202,"category":11610,"categoryJpn":11611,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Leaf Margins","葉の縁",{"id":31,"category":11613,"categoryJpn":11614,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Leaf Venation","葉脈",{"id":64,"category":11616,"categoryJpn":11617,"detail":7,"detailJpn":7},"Leaf Coloration","葉の色",{"id":12,"category":11619,"categoryJpn":11620,"detail":11621,"detailJpn":11622},"Indument, Leaf Surface Characteristics and Texture","被毛、葉の表面の特徴と質感","Many characters that pertain to leaf surfaces ante indument are helpful in Many chion, but many more, such as shagreened leaf upper surfaces (e.g., in identificatiom, Gnetaceae and Tinomiscium, Menispermaceae), ought to be better explored for their utility.
